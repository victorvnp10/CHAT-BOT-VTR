## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing specialized chatbots focused on official document creation for the Brazilian Air Force (FAB). The system allows users to interact with AI-powered chatbots that help create various types of official documents like "Of√≠cios," emails, reports, and meeting minutes, following specific military documentation standards (NSCA 10-2 - 2019).

The application provides a dashboard where users can select from available chatbots, create new conversations, and manage chatbot configurations. It includes a default "SAD VIRTUAL" chatbot pre-configured for document assistance, with the ability to create custom chatbots through an admin interface.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
